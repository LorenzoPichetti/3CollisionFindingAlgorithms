# 3CollisionFindingAlgorithms
This repository implements the algorithms proposed in "Improved Generic Algorithms for 3-Collisions" of A.Joux e S.Lucks.
It is the final workshop for the course "IN450" (algorithms for cryptography) of the University of Roma Tre in the academic year 2019/2020.
We now give a short description of these algorithms, but we highly recommend referring to the original article (publicly available at link https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/305.pdf)
for a full explanation.
